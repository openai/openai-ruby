# OpenAI Ruby API library

The OpenAI Ruby library provides convenient access to the OpenAI REST API from any Ruby 3.2.0+ application. It ships with comprehensive types & docstrings in Yard, RBS, and RBI â€“ [see below](https://github.com/openai/openai-ruby#Sorbet) for usage with Sorbet. The standard library's `net/http` is used as the HTTP transport, with connection pooling via the `connection_pool` gem.

## Documentation

Documentation for releases of this gem can be found [on RubyDoc](https://gemdocs.org/gems/openai).

The REST API documentation can be found on [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/docs).

## Installation

To use this gem, install via Bundler by adding the following to your application's `Gemfile`:

<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->

```ruby
gem "openai", "~> 0.17.0"
```

<!-- x-release-please-end -->

## Usage

```ruby
require "bundler/setup"
require "openai"

openai = OpenAI::Client.new(
  api_key: ENV["OPENAI_API_KEY"] # This is the default and can be omitted
)

chat_completion = openai.chat.completions.create(messages: [{role: "user", content: "Say this is a test"}], model: :"gpt-5")

puts(chat_completion)
```

### Streaming

We provide support for streaming responses using Server-Sent Events (SSE).

```ruby
stream = openai.responses.stream(
  input: "Write a haiku about OpenAI.",
  model: :"gpt-5"
)

stream.each do |event|
  puts(event.type)
end
```

### Pagination

List methods in the OpenAI API are paginated.

This library provides auto-paginating iterators with each list response, so you do not have to request successive pages manually:

```ruby
page = openai.fine_tuning.jobs.list(limit: 20)

# Fetch single item from page.
job = page.data[0]
puts(job.id)

# Automatically fetches more pages as needed.
page.auto_paging_each do |job|
  puts(job.id)
end
```

Alternatively, you can use the `#next_page?` and `#next_page` methods for more granular control working with pages.

```ruby
if page.next_page?
  new_page = page.next_page
  puts(new_page.data[0].id)
end
```

### File uploads

Request parameters that correspond to file uploads can be passed as raw contents, a [`Pathname`](https://rubyapi.org/3.2/o/pathname) instance, [`StringIO`](https://rubyapi.org/3.2/o/stringio), or more.

```ruby
require "pathname"

# Use `Pathname` to send the filename and/or avoid paging a large file into memory:
file_object = openai.files.create(file: Pathname("input.jsonl"), purpose: "fine-tune")

# Alternatively, pass file contents or a `StringIO` directly:
file_object = openai.files.create(file: File.read("input.jsonl"), purpose: "fine-tune")

puts(file_object.id)

# Or, to control the filename and/or content type:
image = OpenAI::FilePart.new(Pathname('dog.jpg'), content_type: 'image/jpeg')
edited = openai.images.edit(
  prompt: "make this image look like a painting",
  model: "gpt-image-1",
  size: '1024x1024',
  image: image
)

puts(edited.data.first)
```

Note that you can also pass a raw `IO` descriptor, but this disables retries, as the library can't be sure if the descriptor is a file or pipe (which cannot be rewound).

## Webhook Verification

Verifying webhook signatures is _optional but encouraged_.

For more information about webhooks, see [the API docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/webhooks).

### Parsing webhook payloads

For most use cases, you will likely want to verify the webhook and parse the payload at the same time. To achieve this, we provide the method `client.webhooks.unwrap`, which parses a webhook request and verifies that it was sent by OpenAI. This method will raise an error if the signature is invalid.

Note that the `body` parameter must be the raw JSON string sent from the server (do not parse it first). The `unwrap` method will parse this JSON for you into an event object after verifying the webhook was sent from OpenAI.

```ruby
require 'sinatra'
require 'openai'

# Set up the client with webhook secret from environment variable
client = OpenAI::Client.new(webhook_secret: ENV['OPENAI_WEBHOOK_SECRET'])

post '/webhook' do
  request_body = request.body.read
  
  begin
    event = client.webhooks.unwrap(request_body, request.env)
    
    case event.type
    when 'response.completed'
      puts "Response completed: #{event.data}"
    when 'response.failed'
      puts "Response failed: #{event.data}"
    else
      puts "Unhandled event type: #{event.type}"
    end
    
    status 200
    'ok'
  rescue StandardError => e
    puts "Invalid signature: #{e}"
    status 400
    'Invalid signature'
  end
end
```

### Verifying webhook payloads directly

In some cases, you may want to verify the webhook separately from parsing the payload. If you prefer to handle these steps separately, we provide the method `client.webhooks.verify_signature` to _only verify_ the signature of a webhook request. Like `unwrap`, this method will raise an error if the signature is invalid.

Note that the `body` parameter must be the raw JSON string sent from the server (do not parse it first). You will then need to parse the body after verifying the signature.

```ruby
require 'sinatra'
require 'json'
require 'openai'

# Set up the client with webhook secret from environment variable
client = OpenAI::Client.new(webhook_secret: ENV['OPENAI_WEBHOOK_SECRET'])

post '/webhook' do
  request_body = request.body.read
  
  begin
    client.webhooks.verify_signature(request_body, request.env)
    
    # Parse the body after verification
    event = JSON.parse(request_body)
    puts "Verified event: #{event}"
    
    status 200
    'ok'
  rescue StandardError => e
    puts "Invalid signature: #{e}"
    status 400
    'Invalid signature'
  end
end
```

### [Structured outputs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs) and function calling

This SDK ships with helpers in `OpenAI::BaseModel`, `OpenAI::ArrayOf`, `OpenAI::EnumOf`, and `OpenAI::UnionOf` to help you define the supported JSON schemas used in making structured outputs and function calling requests.

<details>
<summary>Snippet</summary>

```ruby
# Participant model with an optional last_name and an enum for status
class Participant < OpenAI::BaseModel
  required :first_name, String
  required :last_name, String, nil?: true
  required :status, OpenAI::EnumOf[:confirmed, :unconfirmed, :tentative]
end

# CalendarEvent model with a list of participants.
class CalendarEvent < OpenAI::BaseModel
  required :name, String
  required :date, String
  required :participants, OpenAI::ArrayOf[Participant]
end


client = OpenAI::Client.new

response = client.responses.create(
  model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  input: [
    {role: :system, content: "Extract the event information."},
    {
      role: :user,
      content: <<~CONTENT
        Alice Shah and Lena are going to a science fair on Friday at 123 Main St. in San Diego.
        They have also invited Jasper Vellani and Talia Groves - Jasper has not responded and Talia said she is thinking about it.
      CONTENT
    }
  ],
  text: CalendarEvent
)

response
  .output
  .flat_map { _1.content }
  # filter out refusal responses
  .grep_v(OpenAI::Models::Responses::ResponseOutputRefusal)
  .each do |content|
    # parsed is an instance of `CalendarEvent`
    pp(content.parsed)
  end
```

</details>

See the [examples](https://github.com/openai/openai-ruby/tree/main/examples) directory for more usage examples for helper usage.

To make the equivalent request using raw JSON schema format, you would do the following:

<details>
<summary>Snippet</summary>

```ruby
response = client.responses.create(
  model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  input: [
    {role: :system, content: "Extract the event information."},
    {
      role: :user,
      content: "..."
    }
  ],
  text: {
    format: {
      type: :json_schema,
      name: "CalendarEvent",
      strict: true,
      schema: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
          name: {type: "string"},
          date: {type: "string"},
          participants: {
            type: "array",
            items: {
              type: "object",
              properties: {
                first_name: {type: "string"},
                last_name: {type: %w[string null]},
                status: {type: "string", enum: %w[confirmed unconfirmed tentative]}
              },
              required: %w[first_name last_name status],
              additionalProperties: false
            }
          }
        },
        required: %w[name date participants],
        additionalProperties: false
      }
    }
  }
)
```

</details>

### Handling errors

When the library is unable to connect to the API, or if the API returns a non-success status code (i.e., 4xx or 5xx response), a subclass of `OpenAI::Errors::APIError` will be thrown:

```ruby
begin
  job = openai.fine_tuning.jobs.create(model: :"babbage-002", training_file: "file-abc123")
rescue OpenAI::Errors::APIConnectionError => e
  puts("The server could not be reached")
  puts(e.cause)  # an underlying Exception, likely raised within `net/http`
rescue OpenAI::Errors::RateLimitError => e
  puts("A 429 status code was received; we should back off a bit.")
rescue OpenAI::Errors::APIStatusError => e
  puts("Another non-200-range status code was received")
  puts(e.status)
end
```

Error codes are as follows:

| Cause            | Error Type                 |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| HTTP 400         | `BadRequestError`          |
| HTTP 401         | `AuthenticationError`      |
| HTTP 403         | `PermissionDeniedError`    |
| HTTP 404         | `NotFoundError`            |
| HTTP 409         | `ConflictError`            |
| HTTP 422         | `UnprocessableEntityError` |
| HTTP 429         | `RateLimitError`           |
| HTTP >= 500      | `InternalServerError`      |
| Other HTTP error | `APIStatusError`           |
| Timeout          | `APITimeoutError`          |
| Network error    | `APIConnectionError`       |

### Retries

Certain errors will be automatically retried 2 times by default, with a short exponential backoff.

Connection errors (for example, due to a network connectivity problem), 408 Request Timeout, 409 Conflict, 429 Rate Limit, >=500 Internal errors, and timeouts will all be retried by default.

You can use the `max_retries` option to configure or disable this:

```ruby
# Configure the default for all requests:
openai = OpenAI::Client.new(
  max_retries: 0 # default is 2
)

# Or, configure per-request:
openai.chat.completions.create(
  messages: [{role: "user", content: "How can I get the name of the current day in JavaScript?"}],
  model: :"gpt-5",
  request_options: {max_retries: 5}
)
```

### Timeouts

By default, requests will time out after 600 seconds. You can use the timeout option to configure or disable this:

```ruby
# Configure the default for all requests:
openai = OpenAI::Client.new(
  timeout: nil # default is 600
)

# Or, configure per-request:
openai.chat.completions.create(
  messages: [{role: "user", content: "How can I list all files in a directory using Python?"}],
  model: :"gpt-5",
  request_options: {timeout: 5}
)
```

On timeout, `OpenAI::Errors::APITimeoutError` is raised.

Note that requests that time out are retried by default.

## Advanced concepts

### BaseModel

All parameter and response objects inherit from `OpenAI::Internal::Type::BaseModel`, which provides several conveniences, including:

1. All fields, including unknown ones, are accessible with `obj[:prop]` syntax, and can be destructured with `obj => {prop: prop}` or pattern-matching syntax.

2. Structural equivalence for equality; if two API calls return the same values, comparing the responses with == will return true.

3. Both instances and the classes themselves can be pretty-printed.

4. Helpers such as `#to_h`, `#deep_to_h`, `#to_json`, and `#to_yaml`.

### Making custom or undocumented requests

#### Undocumented properties

You can send undocumented parameters to any endpoint, and read undocumented response properties, like so:

Note: the `extra_` parameters of the same name overrides the documented parameters.

```ruby
chat_completion =
  openai.chat.completions.create(
    messages: [{role: "user", content: "How can I get the name of the current day in JavaScript?"}],
    model: :"gpt-5",
    request_options: {
      extra_query: {my_query_parameter: value},
      extra_body: {my_body_parameter: value},
      extra_headers: {"my-header": value}
    }
  )

puts(chat_completion[:my_undocumented_property])
```

#### Undocumented request params

If you want to explicitly send an extra param, you can do so with the `extra_query`, `extra_body`, and `extra_headers` under the `request_options:` parameter when making a request, as seen in the examples above.

#### Undocumented endpoints

To make requests to undocumented endpoints while retaining the benefit of auth, retries, and so on, you can make requests using `client.request`, like so:

```ruby
response = client.request(
  method: :post,
  path: '/undocumented/endpoint',
  query: {"dog": "woof"},
  headers: {"useful-header": "interesting-value"},
  body: {"hello": "world"}
)
```

### Concurrency & connection pooling

The `OpenAI::Client` instances are threadsafe, but are only fork-safe when there are no in-flight HTTP requests.

Each instance of `OpenAI::Client` has its own HTTP connection pool with a default size of 99. As such, we recommend instantiating the client once per application in most settings.

When all available connections from the pool are checked out, requests wait for a new connection to become available, with queue time counting towards the request timeout.

Unless otherwise specified, other classes in the SDK do not have locks protecting their underlying data structure.

## Sorbet

This library provides comprehensive [RBI](https://sorbet.org/docs/rbi) definitions and has no dependency on sorbet-runtime.

You can provide typesafe request parameters like so:

```ruby
openai.chat.completions.create(
  messages: [OpenAI::Chat::ChatCompletionUserMessageParam.new(content: "Say this is a test")],
  model: :"gpt-5"
)
```

Or, equivalently:

```ruby
# Hashes work, but are not typesafe:
openai.chat.completions.create(messages: [{role: "user", content: "Say this is a test"}], model: :"gpt-5")

# You can also splat a full Params class:
params = OpenAI::Chat::CompletionCreateParams.new(
  messages: [OpenAI::Chat::ChatCompletionUserMessageParam.new(content: "Say this is a test")],
  model: :"gpt-5"
)
openai.chat.completions.create(**params)
```

### Enums

Since this library does not depend on `sorbet-runtime`, it cannot provide [`T::Enum`](https://sorbet.org/docs/tenum) instances. Instead, we provide "tagged symbols" instead, which is always a primitive at runtime:

```ruby
# :minimal
puts(OpenAI::ReasoningEffort::MINIMAL)

# Revealed type: `T.all(OpenAI::ReasoningEffort, Symbol)`
T.reveal_type(OpenAI::ReasoningEffort::MINIMAL)
```

Enum parameters have a "relaxed" type, so you can either pass in enum constants or their literal value:

```ruby
# Using the enum constants preserves the tagged type information:
openai.chat.completions.create(
  reasoning_effort: OpenAI::ReasoningEffort::MINIMAL,
  # â€¦
)

# Literal values are also permissible:
openai.chat.completions.create(
  reasoning_effort: :minimal,
  # â€¦
)
```

## Versioning

This package follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) conventions. As the library is in initial development and has a major version of `0`, APIs may change at any time.

This package considers improvements to the (non-runtime) `*.rbi` and `*.rbs` type definitions to be non-breaking changes.

## Requirements

Ruby 3.2.0 or higher.
