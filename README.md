# OpenAI Ruby API library

The OpenAI Ruby library provides convenient access to the OpenAI REST API from any Ruby 3.1.0+ application.

## Documentation

Documentation for released of this gem can be found [on RubyDoc](https://gemdocs.org/gems/openai).

The underlying REST API documentation can be found on [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/docs).

## Installation

To use this gem, install via Bundler by adding the following to your application's `Gemfile`:

<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->

```ruby
gem "openai", "~> 0.1.0.pre.alpha.3"
```

<!-- x-release-please-end -->

To fetch an initial copy of the gem:

```sh
bundle install
```

## Usage

```ruby
require "bundler/setup"
require "openai"

openai = OpenAI::Client.new(
  api_key: "My API Key" # defaults to ENV["OPENAI_API_KEY"]
)

chat_completion =
  openai.chat.completions.create(
    messages: [{
      role: "user",
      content: "Say this is a test"
    }],
    model: "gpt-4o"
  )

puts(chat_completion)
```

### Pagination

List methods in the OpenAI API are paginated.

This library provides auto-paginating iterators with each list response, so you do not have to request successive pages manually:

```ruby
page = openai.fine_tuning.jobs.list(limit: 20)

# Fetch single item from page.
job = page.data[0]
puts(job.id)

# Automatically fetches more pages as needed.
page.auto_paging_each do |job|
  puts(job.id)
end
```

### Streaming

We provide support for streaming responses using Server Side Events (SSE).

**coming soon:** `openai.chat.completions.stream` will soon come with Python SDK style higher level streaming responses support.

```ruby
stream =
  openai.chat.completions.create_streaming(
    messages: [{
      role: "user",
      content: "Say this is a test"
    }],
    model: "gpt-4o"
  )

stream.each do |completion|
  puts(completion)
end
```

### Errors

When the library is unable to connect to the API, or if the API returns a non-success status code (i.e., 4xx or 5xx response), a subclass of `OpenAI::Error` will be thrown:

```ruby
begin
  job = openai.fine_tuning.jobs.create(model: "gpt-4o", training_file: "file-abc123")
rescue OpenAI::Errors::APIError => e
  puts(e.status) # 400
end
```

Error codes are as followed:

| Cause            | Error Type                 |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| HTTP 400         | `BadRequestError`          |
| HTTP 401         | `AuthenticationError`      |
| HTTP 403         | `PermissionDeniedError`    |
| HTTP 404         | `NotFoundError`            |
| HTTP 409         | `ConflictError`            |
| HTTP 422         | `UnprocessableEntityError` |
| HTTP 429         | `RateLimitError`           |
| HTTP >= 500      | `InternalServerError`      |
| Other HTTP error | `APIStatusError`           |
| Timeout          | `APITimeoutError`          |
| Network error    | `APIConnectionError`       |

### Retries

Certain errors will be automatically retried 2 times by default, with a short exponential backoff.

Connection errors (for example, due to a network connectivity problem), 408 Request Timeout, 409 Conflict, 429 Rate Limit, >=500 Internal errors, and timeouts will all be retried by default.

You can use the `max_retries` option to configure or disable this:

```ruby
# Configure the default for all requests:
openai = OpenAI::Client.new(
  max_retries: 0 # default is 2
)

# Or, configure per-request:
openai.chat.completions.create(
  messages: [{
    role: "user",
    content: "How can I get the name of the current day in JavaScript?"
  }],
  model: "gpt-4o",
  request_options: {max_retries: 5}
)
```

### Timeouts

By default, requests will time out after 600 seconds.

Timeouts are applied separately to the initial connection and the overall request time, so in some cases a request could wait 2\*timeout seconds before it fails.

You can use the `timeout` option to configure or disable this:

```ruby
# Configure the default for all requests:
openai = OpenAI::Client.new(
  timeout: nil # default is 600
)

# Or, configure per-request:
openai.chat.completions.create(
  messages: [{
    role: "user",
    content: "How can I list all files in a directory using Python?"
  }],
  model: "gpt-4o",
  request_options: {timeout: 5}
)
```

## LSP Support

### Solargraph

This library includes [Solargraph](https://solargraph.org) support for both auto completion and go to definition.

```ruby
gem "solargraph", group: :development
```

After Solargraph is installed, **you must populate its index** either via the provided editor command, or by running the following in your terminal:

```sh
bundle exec solargraph gems
```

Otherwise Solargraph will not be able to provide type information or auto-completion for any non-indexed libraries.

### Sorbet

This library is written with [Sorbet type definitions](https://sorbet.org/docs/rbi). However, there is no runtime dependency on the `sorbet-runtime`.

What this means is that while you can use Sorbet to type check your code statically, and benefit from the [Sorbet Language Server](https://sorbet.org/docs/lsp) in your editor, there is no runtime type checking and execution overhead from Sorbet itself.

Due to limitations with the Sorbet type system, where a method otherwise can take an instance of `OpenAI::BaseModel` class, you will need to use the `**` splat operator to pass the arguments:

Please follow Sorbet's [setup guides](https://sorbet.org/docs/adopting) for best experience.

```ruby
params =
  OpenAI::Models::Chat::CompletionCreateParams.new(
    messages: [
      OpenAI::Models::ChatCompletionUserMessageParam.new(
        role: "user",
        content: "Say this is a test"
      )
    ],
    model: "gpt-4o"
  )

openai.chat.completions.create(**params)
```

Note: **This library emits an intentional warning under the [`tapioca` toolchain](https://github.com/Shopify/tapioca)**. This is normal, and does not impact functionality.

### Ruby LSP

The Ruby LSP has [best effort support](https://shopify.github.io/ruby-lsp/#guessed-types) for inferring type information from Ruby code, and as such it may not always be able to provide accurate type information.

## Advanced

### Making custom/undocumented requests

This library is typed for convenient access to the documented API.

If you need to access undocumented endpoints, params, or response properties, the library can still be used.

#### Undocumented request params

If you want to explicitly send an extra param, you can do so with the `extra_query`, `extra_body`, and `extra_headers` under the `request_options:` parameter when making a requests as seen in examples above.

#### Undocumented endpoints

To make requests to undocumented endpoints, you can make requests using `client.request`. Options on the client will be respected (such as retries) when making this request.

```ruby
response =
  client.request(
    method: :post,
    path: '/undocumented/endpoint',
    query: {"dog": "woof"},
    headers: {"useful-header": "interesting-value"},
    body: {"he": "llo"},
  )
```

### Concurrency & Connection Pooling

The `OpenAI::Client` instances are thread-safe, and should be re-used across multiple threads. By default, each `Client` have their own HTTP connection pool, with a maximum number of connections equal to thread count.

When the maximum number of connections has been checked out from the connection pool, the `Client` will wait for an in use connection to become available. The queue time for this mechanism is accounted for by the per-request timeout.

Unless otherwise specified, other classes in the SDK do not have locks protecting their underlying data structure.

Currently, `OpenAI::Client` instances are only fork-safe if there are no in-flight HTTP requests.

## Versioning

This package follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) conventions. As the library is in initial development and has a major version of `0`, APIs may change at any time.

This package considers improvements to the (non-runtime) `*.rbi` and `*.rbs` type definitions to be non-breaking changes.

## Requirements

Ruby 3.1.0 or higher.
