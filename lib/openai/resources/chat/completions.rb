        #
        #     Constrains effort on reasoning for
        #     [reasoning models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning). Currently
        #     supported values are `low`, `medium`, and `high`. Reducing reasoning effort can
        #     result in faster responses and fewer tokens used on reasoning in a response.
        #
        #   @option params [OpenAI::Models::ResponseFormatText, OpenAI::Models::ResponseFormatJSONSchema, OpenAI::Models::ResponseFormatJSONObject] :response_format An object specifying the format that the model must output.
        #
        #     Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured

        #
        #     Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables the older JSON mode, which
        #     ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON. Using `json_schema` is
        #     preferred for models that support it.
        #
        #   @option params [Integer, nil] :seed This feature is in Beta. If specified, our system will make a best effort to
        #     sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and

        #     should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes
        #     in the backend.
        #
        #   @option params [Symbol, OpenAI::Models::Chat::CompletionCreateParams::ServiceTier, nil] :service_tier Specifies the latency tier to use for processing the request. This parameter is
        #     relevant for customers subscribed to the scale tier service:
        #
        #     - If set to 'auto', and the Project is Scale tier enabled, the system will
        #       utilize scale tier credits until they are exhausted.
        #     - If set to 'auto', and the Project is not Scale tier enabled, the request will
        #       be processed using the default service tier with a lower uptime SLA and no
        #       latency guarentee.
        #     - If set to 'default', the request will be processed using the default service
        #       tier with a lower uptime SLA and no latency guarentee.
        #     - When not set, the default behavior is 'auto'.
        #
        #     When this parameter is set, the response body will include the `service_tier`
        #     utilized.
        #
        #   @option params [String, Array<String>, nil] :stop Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The
        #     returned text will not contain the stop sequence.
        #
        #   @option params [Boolean, nil] :store Whether or not to store the output of this chat completion request for use in
        #     our [model distillation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/distillation)
        #     or [evals](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/evals) products.
        #
        #   @option params [OpenAI::Models::Chat::ChatCompletionStreamOptions, nil] :stream_options Options for streaming response. Only set this when you set `stream: true`.
        #
        #   @option params [Float, nil] :temperature What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will
        #     make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more
        #     focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but
        #     not both.
        #
        #   @option params [Symbol, OpenAI::Models::Chat::ChatCompletionToolChoiceOption::Auto, OpenAI::Models::Chat::ChatCompletionNamedToolChoice] :tool_choice Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. `none` means the model will
        #     not call any tool and instead generates a message. `auto` means the model can
        #     pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. `required` means
        #     the model must call one or more tools. Specifying a particular tool via
        #     `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to
        #     call that tool.
        #
        #     `none` is the default when no tools are present. `auto` is the default if tools
        #     are present.
        #
        #   @option params [Array<OpenAI::Models::Chat::ChatCompletionTool>] :tools A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a
        #     tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs
        #     for. A max of 128 functions are supported.
        #
        #   @option params [Integer, nil] :top_logprobs An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to
        #     return at each token position, each with an associated log probability.
        #     `logprobs` must be set to `true` if this parameter is used.
        #
        #   @option params [Float, nil] :top_p An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the
        #     model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1
        #     means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.
        #
        #     We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.
        #
        #   @option params [String] :user A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor

        #
        #   @option params [Integer, nil] :n How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that
        #     you will be charged based on the number of generated tokens across all of the
        #     choices. Keep `n` as `1` to minimize costs.
        #
        #   @option params [Boolean] :parallel_tool_calls Whether to enable
        #     [parallel function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling#configuring-parallel-function-calling)
        #     during tool use.
        #
        #   @option params [OpenAI::Models::Chat::ChatCompletionPredictionContent, nil] :prediction Static predicted output content, such as the content of a text file that is
        #     being regenerated.
        #
        #   @option params [Float, nil] :presence_penalty Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
        #     whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to
        #     talk about new topics.
        #
        #   @option params [Symbol, OpenAI::Models::ReasoningEffort, nil] :reasoning_effort **o-series models only**
        #
        #     Constrains effort on reasoning for
        #     [reasoning models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning). Currently
        #     supported values are `low`, `medium`, and `high`. Reducing reasoning effort can
        #     result in faster responses and fewer tokens used on reasoning in a response.
        #
        #   @option params [OpenAI::Models::ResponseFormatText, OpenAI::Models::ResponseFormatJSONSchema, OpenAI::Models::ResponseFormatJSONObject] :response_format An object specifying the format that the model must output.
        #
        #     Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured
        #     Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more
        #     in the
        #     [Structured Outputs guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs).
        #
        #     Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables the older JSON mode, which
        #     ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON. Using `json_schema` is
        #     preferred for models that support it.
        #
        #   @option params [Integer, nil] :seed This feature is in Beta. If specified, our system will make a best effort to
        #     sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and
        #     parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you
        #     should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes
        #     in the backend.
        #
        #   @option params [Symbol, OpenAI::Models::Chat::CompletionCreateParams::ServiceTier, nil] :service_tier Specifies the latency tier to use for processing the request. This parameter is
        #     relevant for customers subscribed to the scale tier service:
        #
        #     - If set to 'auto', and the Project is Scale tier enabled, the system will
        #       utilize scale tier credits until they are exhausted.
        #     - If set to 'auto', and the Project is not Scale tier enabled, the request will
        #       be processed using the default service tier with a lower uptime SLA and no
        #       latency guarentee.
        #     - If set to 'default', the request will be processed using the default service
        #       tier with a lower uptime SLA and no latency guarentee.
        #     - When not set, the default behavior is 'auto'.
        #
        #     When this parameter is set, the response body will include the `service_tier`
        #     utilized.
        #
        #   @option params [String, Array<String>, nil] :stop Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The
        #     returned text will not contain the stop sequence.
        #
        #   @option params [Boolean, nil] :store Whether or not to store the output of this chat completion request for use in
        #     our [model distillation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/distillation)
        #     or [evals](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/evals) products.
        #
        #   @option params [OpenAI::Models::Chat::ChatCompletionStreamOptions, nil] :stream_options Options for streaming response. Only set this when you set `stream: true`.
        #
        #   @option params [Float, nil] :temperature What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will
        #     make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more
        #     focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but
        #     not both.
        #
        #   @option params [Symbol, OpenAI::Models::Chat::ChatCompletionToolChoiceOption::Auto, OpenAI::Models::Chat::ChatCompletionNamedToolChoice] :tool_choice Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. `none` means the model will
        #     not call any tool and instead generates a message. `auto` means the model can
        #     pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. `required` means
        #     the model must call one or more tools. Specifying a particular tool via
        #     `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to
        #     call that tool.
        #
        #     `none` is the default when no tools are present. `auto` is the default if tools
        #     are present.
        #
        #   @option params [Array<OpenAI::Models::Chat::ChatCompletionTool>] :tools A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a
        #     tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs
        #     for. A max of 128 functions are supported.
        #
        #   @option params [Integer, nil] :top_logprobs An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to
        #     return at each token position, each with an associated log probability.
        #     `logprobs` must be set to `true` if this parameter is used.
        #
        #   @option params [Float, nil] :top_p An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the
        #     model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1
        #     means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.
        #
        #     We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.
        #
        #   @option params [String] :user A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor
        #     and detect abuse.
